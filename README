[+] Introduction
-------------------------------

  Quick NIX Secure Script is used to harden and secure basic permissions
  and ownership on the fly.  This script can be used during boot up, cron,
  bootstrapping, kickstart, jumpstart and during other system deployments.

  Many times in (prod)uction world prior system admins harden without 
  automation or towards a baseline. This is to help get to a point
  of standardization and quickly setting or re-setting permissions.

  Everyone is free to use Quick NIX Secure Script under the conditions of 
  the GPL v3 license (see LICENSE file).
